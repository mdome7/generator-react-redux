# generator-react-redux

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for bootstrapping a simple ReactJS app with Redux.

!!! STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT !!!

Developing This Generator
--------------------

During development, you may or may not feel the need to test the changes.  If you're one of the crazy ones
and actually choose to test your code, you will want to link the local project codebase to the global npm module:

On the command line, from the project root folder:

```
npm link
```

Then, when you can run the generator elsewhere:

```
mkdir -p /tmp/my-new-project
cd /tmp/my-new-project
yo react-redux
```
